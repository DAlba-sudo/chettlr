## What is the point of this?

Chettlr is an investment I am making to help my chess training. While I do plan on using Chettlr as _the main place_ to build out my tools, it will begin by providing the following functions:

1. Given a Lichess account, pull the latest games.
2. Analyze the latest games by doing the following:
   - Identify positional mistakes.
   - Identify tactical mistakes.
   - Identify alternate moves in a position.

## From an architectural POV, how are you implementing this?

- [Chettlr Version 0.0] will only need to be able to provide a rendering (via HTML Images) of a chess board. It will not require an interactive board.
    - Therefore, we only need to be able to take a position (in FEN, or a similar format) and render it. This can be done using a home-made rendering engine, or with off the shelf libraries.
- We will use Golang due to it's maturity in the web-dev space.
